<h6>3. HOW INFORMATION IS USED, SHARED AND DISCLOSED</h6>
CP Publisher does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Except as set forth in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy, parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as CP Publisher does not share information that may be collected from your child. CP Publisher uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the CP Publisher Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of CP Publisher’s business. Examples of how CP Publisher shares and discloses your information is as follows:

Legal. CP Publisher may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise CP Publisher’s legal rights. CP Publisher may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when CP Publisher believes that disclosure is necessary to protect CP Publisher’s rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. CP Publisher may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CP Publisher’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

Business Transfers. As CP Publisher continues to develop its business, CP Publisher may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of CP Publisher’s assets are acquired or CP Publisher merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that CP Publisher reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, CP Publisher will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control. CP Publisher may use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on CP Publisher’s behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. CP Publisher will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. CP Publisher shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.

<h6>4. SECURITY</h6>

CP Publisher follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to CP Publisher, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, CP Publisher cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, CP Publisher and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by CP Publisher. For CP Publisher, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a “need to know” basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by CP Publisher is done so via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using secure socket layer technology,”SSL”) by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.

Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

<h6>6. SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AND TOOLS</h6>
The CP Publisher Services may include integrated social media features and tools, such as the Facebook “Like” button, the YouTube “Share This” button, and interactive mini-programs that run in the CP Publisher Services. These Features may collect information on your IP address, which page you are visiting on CP Publisher’s site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
